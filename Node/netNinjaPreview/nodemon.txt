what does nodemon do?
it automatically restarts the server upon a save
so that us as developers do not have to restart
after every change

to install globally 
npm install -g nodemon

now.. instead of typing node app.. we can type:
nodemon app.js

and now the server restarts on its own without the need
of typing node app or nodemon app.js every time
