Express Routers & Controllers

Express Generator
a popular tool: express-generator.
express-generator creates a “skeleton” Express app that:
Separates the HTTP server code from our web app’s logic.
Has best practice routing implemented.
Has key middleware configured and mounted by default.
Is configured to serve static assets from a public folder.
Will configure the EJS view engine (if we specify the -e option)
Has error handling configured.

Install express-generator
npm install -g express-generator
express-generator is a CLI that can be run from anywhere, that’s why we install it using the global -g flag.

Specify the View Engine
We’ll definitely want to use the EJS view engine each time we scaffold a new Express project.

-e
-ejs
--view=ejs
-v=ejs
The help above identifies the following option flags to make EJS the view engine
All of the above option flags do the exact same thing, kind of like the shortest one

We scaffold an app using the express command:
express -e express-todos
^creates an express folder called express-todos with ejs view engine
