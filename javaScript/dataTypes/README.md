Seven primitive data types which represent a single value
Boolean
String
Number & BigInt
Null
Undefined
Symbol
…and an Object type which is a collection of properties, where each property itself can hold any data type, including another object.

In addition to “plain objects”, there are several built-in object sub-types such as:

Array
Date
Function (yes, functions are objects in JavaScript!)
RegExp
Error
KEY POINT: If a variable does not hold one of the seven primitive values, it is an object!
