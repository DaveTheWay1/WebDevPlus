// * number
// A number represents a numeric value.
// Unlike many other programming languages, // * there is no distinction between 
// * integer (15, 3, etc.) and floating-point/decimal types (17.24, 3.1416, etc.).
// * Internally, JS represents all numbers as floating-point values.

// * ex:
let num1 = 15;
let num2 = 15.6
