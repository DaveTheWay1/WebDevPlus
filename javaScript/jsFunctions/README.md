What is a function?
A function is a reusable block of code written to perform a single purpose.

What is a JS expression
A piece of code that JS evaluates into a single value or object

Functions are the primary building blocks of programs.

Why Functions Anyway?
Tackle Complexity
    Functions allow us to break up programs into more manageable blocks of code.
Code Reuse
    Without functions, we might have to write the same code in multiple places of the app which violates a key programming principle known as DRY - Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself!

Can you identify any downsides of repeating the same code in multiple places of a program?
    It would make maintenance and future development of the app over time more difficult and expensive because changes to repeated block of code would require searching and updating all instances of that code.

Documentation
Simply naming functions appropriately, e.g., renderBoard, documents what the program is doing.

By using numerous, smaller and well-named functions, the code virtually becomes self-documenting thus eliminating the need to clutter the code with comments.

In summary, it would be impractical if not impossible to create a comprehensive application without breaking up the application into functions!
