// * The What and Why of Objects

// ? What Are Objects?
// * Objects are the most common data structure in Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

// In JavaScript, an object is an instance of the Object class/data type, or one of its subtypes (Date, Function, RegExp, etc.).

// * In JavaScript, an object might look like this….
// * The below object has three properties...
// {
//   name: 'Maria',
//   birthDate: new Date(2000, 3, 15),
//   numSiblings: 2
// }

// ? So what’s a property? 
// * A property consists of a key: value pair
// * key 
// is a string or symbol (other types will be coerced into strings)
// * value 
// is any JS expression (code that evaluates to a single value or object)

// ? Why Objects?
// * In OOP, we often model the purpose of our application using real-world objects

// * examples of what objects might be used for
// The browser window and the elements it visualizes are all represented in memory as JS objects.
// Those elements and most of their properties, including their styling, are represented as JS objects.
// Data submitted from the browser will be accessed on the backend server as objects.
// Data retrieved from a database will be stored in objects.
