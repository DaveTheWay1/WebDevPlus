// * Objects
// Objects are the most common data structure in Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
// an object is an instance of the Object class/data type, or one of its subtypes (Date, Function, RegExp, etc.).

// * In JavaScript, an object might look like this…

// * The below object has three properties...
// {
//     name: 'Maria',
//     birthDate: new Date(2000, 3, 15),
//     numSiblings: 2
// }
// * Objects are simply a collection of zero or more properties separated by a comma.

// ? So what’s a property? 
// A property consists of a key: value pair, where the:
// * key 
// is a string or symbol (other types will be coerced into strings), and the
// * value 
// is any JS expression (code that evaluates to a single value or object)

// * Note: It is not necessary, nor customary to wrap the key names with quotes, however, they will indeed be strings.

// ? Why Objects?
// encapsulation: the idea of bundling together related values
// The browser window and the elements it visualizes are all represented in memory as JS objects.
// Those elements and most of their properties, including their styling, are represented as JS objects.
// Data submitted from the browser will be accessed on the backend server as objects.
// Data retrieved from a database will be stored in objects.
