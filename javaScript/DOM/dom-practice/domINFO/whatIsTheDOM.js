// * The DOM (Document Object Model) 
// is the in-memory data structure that represents the browser’s web document
// it’s a tree-like data structure with the top (root) being the document object.

// ? What JS data type would each of those nodes be?
// Nodes most certainly will be JS objects with properties 
// used to get/set information and methods to manipulate the DOM.

// * If we type document 
// in DevTool’s console, we’ll see the HTML-centric representation of the document, 

// * however, we want to explore the JavaScript data structure that is the DOM.
// * dir(document)
// by typing dir(document) in console and exploring the objects and properties of the DOM.

// * The DOM has an application programming interface (API) that 
// enables developers to make the UI dynamic by using JavaScript to:
// * Add/remove elements to/from the document
// * Change the content of elements
// * Change an element’s styling
// * Listen for events, e.g., when an element is clicked
// * Animate elements
