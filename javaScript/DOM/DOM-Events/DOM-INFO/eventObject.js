// * The Event Object

// * Examining the event object that 
// was provided as an argument to our event 
// istener reveals lots of useful information about the event!

// * Of special interest are:
// * Several ...X and ...Y properties 
// that provide where the click occurred.

// * The target property, which holds a 
// reference to the DOM element that triggered (dispatched) the event.
// * The target property will certainly be the one to 
// remember as it will be used very often moving forward.
