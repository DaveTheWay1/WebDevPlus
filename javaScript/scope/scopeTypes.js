// * Types of Scope in JavaScript

// * JavaScript has 3 types of scope:

// * Global Scope: 
// There’s always a single global scope which lives 
// at the top of the scope chain.

// * Function Scope, also known as Local Scope: 
// Every time a function runs, 
// it creates its own function/local scope.

// * Block Scope: 
// This scope is courtesy of ES2015’s let & 
// const keywords and in general, define a scope 
// within a code block using curly braces.

// * Why the Different Types of Scope?
// There’s a concept in programming known as // * The Principle of Least Privilege.

// * One of the keys of this principle is 
// based on the idea that limiting the accessibility 
// of variables (and functions) helps reduce bugs in the 
// code - think of it as a form of “code safety”.
